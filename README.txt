Front-end:
The front-end, also known as the client-side, refers to the part of a website that is visible to user. 
It involves the technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and components that users interact with directly. 
Front-End Technologies : 
- HTML : HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. In this some tags and the elements are used to create the structure of the web page.
- CSS : CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used to style the HTML webpages.
- JavaScript: JavaScript is a scripting language that runs in the web browser.
  It is use to provides functionality in web pages.

Back-end:
The back-end, also known as the server-side. 
It involves the server, database, and the server-side programming that manage and process data. 
Back-End Technologies :

- Node.js : Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. 
 It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side. It enable developer to create web applications. 
- Express.js : Express.js is a framework for Node.js. It is use to handle HTTP requests and responses. 
- MongoDB : MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in JSON-like documents. It is highly scalabile.

HTML tags are building blocks use to create the structure of webpages. They are enclosed in angle brackets "<>".

- Structural Tags: 
<html>: This tag represents the root element of an HTML document.
<head>: It contains meta-information about the webpage, such as the title, links for CSS stylesheets.
<body>: This contains tags which are shown on the webpage.
- Heading Tags:
These tags are used to define headings.
<h1> to <h6>. <h1> being the highest level and <h6> the lowest.
- Paragraph Tags:
These tags are used to define paragraphs in webpage. <p>
- Link Tags:
These tags are used to create hyperlinks to other webpages. <a>
- Image Tags:
These tags are used to insert images into a webpage. <img>

The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a technique used in JavaScript frameworks like React to optimize the 
rendering the user interface of a web application.
- Initial Rendering:
When a React component is first rendered, it creates a virtual representation of the entire DOM hierarchy,
known as the Virtual DOM.
- Virtual DOM Representation:
The Virtual DOM consists of elements or components with their associated properties and attributes, similar to the actual DOM. 
 However, the Virtual DOM is purely a JavaScript object and does not have any real impact on the web page.
- Update to the Actual DOM:
 Rather than updating each individual DOM element, React applies the changes in a batched manner, 
 minimizing the number of direct manipulations to the DOM.
 
- MySQL : MySQL is the Relational Database System. 
 It stores the data in the form of tables and 
 each tabke contains Fiels and Rows. It is vertically scalable.
 It Handle Structured data.
 Examples : MySql, Oracle.

- NoSQL : NoSQL is the Non Relational Database System. 
 It store the data in form of key-value pair.
 it is horizontally scalable.
 It Handle unstructured data.
 Examples : MongoDB, RavenDB.

 MongoDB
 It is a NoSQL database System. MongoDB stores data in JSON-like format 
 or we can say in key-value pair known as BSON (Binary JSON). 
 which allows for dynamic schemas and easy representation of complex data structures.
 MongoDB provides functionality for managing and organizing large amounts of structured and unstructured data.
 MQL stands for MongoDB Query Language which is use to manipulating data stored in MongoDB 
 in a flexible and efficient manner.
 MongoDB database is highly Scalable and follows horizontal approach.
 Generally, MongoDB is use for the development of MERN Stack Web Application.
